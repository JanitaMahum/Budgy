__BUDGY__

__A personal budgeting finance app geared towards busy university students__

This is a form based application our group created to easily calculate expenses and savings for busy university students on the go. This will make life easier for students as it allows them to quickly add expenses and keep track of their daily finances. 

The final version of our project is in the folder labelled "Budgy Application" in the master branch. Once inside the folder, you can locate it in the "src" file which contains both packages for our application. The package labelled "backend" contains all code related to textbased version of our app, the package labelled "application" contains all code related to the graphical user interface of our app.  

To run the code please download/clone the Budgy repo.

Once you have downloaded it, unzip and open the folder in an Eclipse workspace.

Navigate to src folder and prepare to run program. 

To run textbased application:

  - Navigate to package labelled "backend" and run it. 
  
  
To run GUI:

  - Navigate to package labelled "application" and run it.
